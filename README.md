# 404-music-not-found
Onset detection, tempo estimation and beat detection developed as part of the Special Topic "Audio and Music Processing" at JKU in summer semester 2022.


The Rust project is missing the 404 in its name, as names starting with digits are not allowed :(


Idea:
* Rust commandline tool
* Onset detection, tempo estimation and beat tracking possible and executed in parallel
* Folders and single files can be processed
